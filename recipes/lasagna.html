    <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven 
        preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, 
        then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important 
        to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut 
        into it.</p>
<h3>How to Reheat Lasagna</h3>
<p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, 
    but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat l
    asagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F f
    or about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.</p>
