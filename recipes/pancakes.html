    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already have 
        everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes.

    </p>
    <h4>Flour</h4>
    <p>All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes 
        structure and pleasant chewiness.</p>
    <h4>Sugar</h4>
    <p>Granulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, 
        and may create a tender texture.</p>
    <h4>Baking Powder</h4>
    <p>Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, 
        which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.</p>
    <h4>Salt</h4>
    <p>Salt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including pancakes. 
        You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but you'll miss 
        it if you leave it out.</p>
    <h4>Egg</h4>
    <p>Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. 
        The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.</p>
    <h4>Milk</h4>
    <p>ot only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential 
        for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.</p>
    <h4>Vegetable Oil</h4>
    <p>Vegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to use 
        in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them from 
        sticking to the pan.

    </p>
    <h4>Bananas</h4>
    <p>You'll need two mashed bananas for these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor.

    </p>
    <h3>How to make the Pancakes</h3>
    <h4>Mix</h4>
    <p>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl 
        and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another 
        bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until
         they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.

    </p>
    <h4>Cook</h4>
    <p>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan 
        or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, 
        and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).</p>
    <h4>Serve</h4>
    <p>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your
         favorite pancake toppings.</p>
    <h3>Banana Pancake Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maple syrup-just a drizzle is enough</li>
        <li>Honey and peanut butter</li>
        <li>Fruit and whipped cream</li>
        <li>Nutella</li>
        <li>Jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Storing Your Banana Pancakes</h3>
    <p>You can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for about two to 
        three days. When you're ready to eat them, just reheat in the microwave 
        ntil the pancakes are warmed through.

    </p>
    <p>If you-'d like to freeze your pancakes, just allow them to cool to room temperature,
         stack them in an airtight container with wax paper between each pancake 
         (to prevent sticking), and freeze for about three months.

        There's no need to thaw frozen pancakes. Simply reheat them in the toaster, 
        microwave, or oven.
