    <h3>What to Serve with Chicken Tortilla Soup</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken tortilla soup is great on its own, or garnished with avocado, 
        cheese, green onions, and sour cream. You can also serve it alongside 
        crusty bread or a side salad for the perfect meal.
    </p>
    <h3>How to Store Chicken Tortilla Soup</h3>
    <p>
        Ladle (completely cooled) chicken tortilla soup into airtight containers 
        and store in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on 
        the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chicken tortilla soup freezes well, so it's a great meal to make ahead of 
        time and stash in the freezer for quick weeknight dinners.

Ladle (completely cooled) chicken tortilla soup into airtight freezer containers 
or zip-top freezer bags and store in the freezer. If using zip-top bags, make sure 
to freeze them flat.

Chicken tortilla soup will last up to three months in the freezer. Thaw in the refrigerator
 overnight.
